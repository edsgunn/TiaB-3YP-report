\section{Introduction}

The process of writing music often begins with and idea for a melody which is followed by the development of chords to accompany it.
The matching of chords to a melody is a skill which usually requires years of training in musical techniques such as harminisation.
There is a large market of amateur musicians who lack the necessary training for this task but would otherwise enjoy the experience of developing music.  
In this report we will detail the design of \textbf{INSERT NAME HERE}, a system which facilitates the generation of an appropriately matched set of chords to a given monophonic melody.
Users are able to record a melody using their microphone and regenerate the chord sequence until they feel the they have found one suitable for the intended feel of their song.
Songs and generated chord accompaniments can be played back to the user, saved to a library of songs and shared using our songwriting community feature. \\
The problem of converting a recorded melody to a set of chords can be decomposed into a set of simpler sub-probblems, these being:
The conversion of the recorded melody into a form which numerically represents its features. 
The generation of a set of chords from this numerical representation.
The latter of these two problems can be solved in many ways many of which require a detailed knowlege of music to find patterns in melodies to match to chords.  
\textbf{WHY IS THIS A PROBELM FOR US}
A method which requires little knowlege of music is the used of a machine learning model to extract these patters from data of known chord melody pairings from professionally composed music. 
The curation and processing of an appropriate dataset requires significant effort and care in itself.
This leads to a natural division of labour across the project into the catagories of:
User Interface and general product design - detailed in \ref{Chapter2} by Di Wan;
Curation and preparation of a dataset in an appropriate format - detailed in \ref{Chapter3} by Terence Tan;
The design of an appropriate machine learning model - detailed in \ref{Chapter4} by Edward Gunn;
The conversion of recorded melody to the same format as expressed in the dataset - detailed in \ref{Chapter5} by Kitty Fung.

\subsection{Musical terminology}

Throught this report we will use a variety of musical terminoligy which will be defined here. A piece of music is composed of a sequence of adjacent \textbf{measures}, periods of time in which notes and chords can be played. 
We will generally take a \textbf{measure} to mean a bar in the music, however it is not restricted to this. We restrict \textbf{chord} to refer to a triad of notes, the justification for this is explained in \textbf{reference to explanation}.
The use of \textbf{melody} refers to a monophonic melody in which only one note is played at a time, excluding accompanying chords, unless otherwise stated.

\section{Ethics}
Data privacy:
Data ethics framework: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework
From a developer’s POV, we should:
(i)	Treat our users’ data as we would for our own
(ii)	Collect only necessary data for the app to run
(iii)	Make sure our app does harm in any way (i.e. won’t include sensitive topics/ as the app carries on, there will not be a chance for our users to online abuse others)
(iv)	Be transparent with our user community -> have to delineate a privacy policy and makes sure users read and agree to everything before they use our app & probably keep the policy at a place that’s easy for everyone to access
Took a look at random online sites’ privacy and here’s a summary of what needs to be included:
(a)	Who we are – company licence and registration reference number, we have to register on https://ico.org.uk/ to collect data from the public
(b)	Delineate the details and purpose of data collected
i.e. we will collect 
- audio data(including metadata) to feed in our model to improve accuracy
- networks and connections (for our interactive community feature)
- usage (contents users view/ engage with, functions/features used, duration)
- device information (device attributes like signal strength, battery levels/ OS versions)
- cookie data, when users comment/ interact on our app, we would want to save their usage preference (we would have both first- and third-party cookies since we will be placing advertisements in our app for standard users) (“We use cookies to help personalise and improve content and services, provide a safer experience and to show you useful and relevant ads on and off”)
- Data retention/ account deletion (we should store data until it is not necessary to collect/ users deactivate account)
(c)	Access rights of different members of the team
(d)	Third parties that will have access to the data collected
(e)	Rights that users have over their data (users should have the right to request a copy of data provided/ request the organisation to delete the data/ object to the organisation’s data processing)
(f)	Notification of changes to privacy policy and ask users to review/ accept the revised policy (if needed)
(g)	Security standards (SSL/ encryption standards)
(h)	Contact information
