\section{Conclusion}

In this work we presented ReChorder, a product designed to be able to provide suitable accompaniment, in the form of chords, to amateur musicians who would not otherwise be able to write their own accompaniment.
We broke the product down into 
product design, specifically UI and UX; 
a community feature powered by a recommendation engine; 
an audio processor to convert a recording into an useable data format; 
a data processor to extract features from the data and put it in a suitable format for input to the model;
and a machine learning model to generate the chords from an encoded melody. 
\\
From our study of product design we determined that \textbf{WHAT DID WE DETERMINE?}
And from these findings we chose to \textbf{WHAT DID WE USE FOR THE PRODUCT?}
\\
As an essential part of the community feature we designed a recommendation engine to provide users with the most engaging content.
We found from other work on recommendation engines that  \textbf{WHAT DID WE DETERMINE?}
and hence designed our product to include \textbf{WHAT DID WE USE FOR THE PRODUCT?}
\\
To convert raw recorded audio to an useable format we found that we needed \textbf{LIST COMPONENTS OF AP i.e. FILTER}
From an analysis of these components we learned \textbf{WHAT DID WE DETERMINE?}
and thus we designed our product using \textbf{WHAT DID WE USE FOR THE PRODUCT?}
\\
To train our model we needed a dataset and a way to encode this data to make it suitable as input.
We discovered from other work that \textbf{WHAT DID WE DETERMINE?}
so we \textbf{WHAT DID WE USE FOR THE PRODUCT?}
\\
To generate chords from a melody we needed a suitable model, we explored our options from the literature and determined that \textbf{WHAT DID WE DETERMINE?}
Using this evolution we proposed the use of \textbf{WHAT DID WE USE FOR THE PRODUCT?}
