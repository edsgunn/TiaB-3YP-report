abstract = {We introduce MySong, a system that automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody. A user with no musical experience can create a song with instrumental accompaniment just by singing into a microphone, and can experiment with different styles and chord patterns using interactions designed to be intuitive to non-musicians.We describe the implementation of MySong, which trains a Hidden Markov Model using a music database and uses that model to select chords for new melodies. Model parameters are intuitively exposed to the user. We present results from a study demonstrating that chords assigned to melodies using MySong and chords assigned manually by musicians receive similar subjective ratings. We then present results from a second study showing that thirteen users with no background in music theory are able to rapidly create musical accompaniments using MySong, and that these accompaniments are rated positively by evaluators.},

@article{ReinforcementLearning,
	abstract = {We present a novel reinforcement learning architecture that learns a structured representation for use in symbolic melody harmonization. Probabilistic models are predominant in melody harmonization tasks, most of which only treat melody notes as independent observations and do not take note of substructures in the melodic sequence. To fill this gap, we add substructure discovery as a crucial step in automatic chord generation. The proposed method consists of a structured representation module that generates hierarchical structures for the symbolic melodies, a policy module that learns to break a melody into segments (whose boundaries concur with chord changes) and phrases (the subunits in segments) and a harmonization module that generates chord sequences for each segment. We formulate the structure discovery process as a sequential decision problem with a policy gradient RL method selecting the boundary of each segment or phrase to obtain an optimized structure. We conduct experiments on our preprocessed HookTheory Lead Sheet Dataset, which has 17,979 melody/chord pairs. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can learn task-specific representations and, thus, yield competitive results compared with state-of-the-art baselines.},

@article{HMMswithML,
	abstract = {Accompaniment production is one of the most important elements in music work, and chord arrangement is the key link of accompaniment production, which usually requires more musical talent and profound music theory knowledge to be competent. In this article, the machine learning model is used to replace manual accompaniment chords\&{\#}x2019; arrangement, and an automatic computer means is provided to complete and assist accompaniment chords\&{\#}x2019; arrangement. Also, through music feature extraction, automatic chord label construction, and model construction and training, the whole system finally has the ability of automatic accompaniment chord arrangement for the main melody. Based on the research of automatic chord label construction method and the characteristics of MIDI data format, a chord analysis method based on interval difference is proposed to construct chord labels of the whole track and realize the construction of automatic chord labels. In this study, the hidden Markov model is constructed according to the chord types, in which the input features are the improved theme PCP features proposed in this paper, and the input labels are the label data set constructed by the automated method proposed in this paper. After the training is completed, the PCP features of the theme to be predicted and improved are input to generate the accompaniment chords of the final arrangement. Through PCP features and template-matching model, the system designed in this paper improves the matching accuracy of the generated chords compared with that generated by the traditional method.},

Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls "validated learning" about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments.},
